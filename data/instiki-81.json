        "This paper aims to review the current development of vessels with solar power to reference the research and development of solar power vessels in Indonesia. The research method is a systematic literature review on the development of solar-powered vessels and includes an online survey of vessels using solar PV. This study found 86 solar-powered vessels consisting of boats, utility boats, ferries, houseboats, research, vehicle carriers, dive boats, and yachts developed from 1988 to 2020. These solar-powered vessels were built for various functions such as competitions, cleaning the environment, passenger transportation, and water tourism.\u00a0 Production of solar-powered vessels is increasing in terms of production volume, PV capacity, and battery capacity. In terms of PV configuration, the solar array is dominated by a fixed array structure. However, there have been innovations using sun-tracking, wind tracking airfoils, and expandable channels to increase PV capacity."
