        "Identification of Metal Artifacts Finds from Intan Shipwreck Information on discoveries of shipwrecks with its various trade commodities in the water territory of Nusantara has an important meaning. Different types of artifacts such as ceramics, glass artifacts, potteries, stone artifacts, and metal artifacts like those found at the Intan Wreck Site prove the important role of sea transportation in water territory of Nusantara. Metal artifacts found there comprise various types including ingots, pans\/trays, mirrors, bells, etc. From a number of analyses that have been carried out, it is strongly assumed that those artifacts are from around 9th - 10th centuries AD, which can be atrtributed to a period of transition from the Ancient Mataram Empire in Central Java to East Java, as well as the Sriwijaya Kingdom with its capital in Palembang."
