        "Religion and Religious Teaching During the Majapahit Period. During the Majapahitperiod religious teaching played an important role. The teaching could be done individually or in acentre for religious teaching called \u201cMandala\u201d or \u201cKadewaguruan\u201d. A Kadewaguruan was usually located far from habitation places (cities), such as quiet forest, on top of a hill, mountain slope, or by the sea shore. A Kadewaguruan is led by a mah\u0101resi (high priest), who is also known as \u015biddharesi or dewaguru; hence the education centre is called Kadewaguruan. In his daily activities, a dewaguru was assisted by his senior disciples named ubwan, female priests, and manguyu or male priests. New disciples were called kaki, tapaswi (male ones) and endang or tapi, kili (female ones). The teachings were taught in phases. During the first phase (supportive teachings), ceremony procedures (d\u012bks\u0101widhi-widh\u0101na) were taught, and in the next phases were taught the main teachings about the concept of the Utmost Reality and the attempt to unite oneself (kal\u011bpasan, moksa) with Bhattara (god). The summary of the dewaguru teachings can be found in religious manuscripts named Tutur."
