        "The purpose of this study is to analyze whether students concentrate or not on the teaching and learning process at Pematangsiantar Park in SMP. To determine the concentration of students in the teaching and learning process, the Naive Bayes classification of data mining methods is used. Sources of research data were obtained using a questionnaire distributed to Pematangsiantar Park Middle School. So hopefully this research can help the government and the school in monitoring the concentration of students so that it can help in improving the quality and quality of schools. Based on that research that has been done,the writer uses the Na\u00efve Bayes Method to predict student concentration resulting in a value of 95.31%, while the predicition of lack of concentration results in a value of 100.00%"
