        "The research purpose to design a motorcycle safety alert system using ultrasonic sensors to detect objects within reach and using the microcontroller as the brain of the process control system so that it can be used to build electrical systems. The bike's safety-distance warning system uses fuzzy logic in the soft computing category, a method that could process uncertain, inaccurate, and less cost implemented data. With this system, it can help the community to reduce the number of a road accident to generate output in some conditions such as safe, carefully, and dangerous by using alarm warnings that can cause sound and LED as virtual and LCD notifications that can display distances in efficient and effective. Based on the results of the tests being done, the sensor system is accurate at 95.242% at 10 times the test."
