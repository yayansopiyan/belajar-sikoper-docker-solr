        "The quality of education is very important for success in learning, by using various methods or tools to make it easier for students to understand discrete mathematics material, based on the 23% graduation rate of students who do not complete discrete mathematics at XYZ University, it is necessary to innovate learning applications, use The game education application provides convenience in developing learning media, namely the Digital Math Game, an Android-based mobile application that makes it easy for students to learn discrete mathematics. This application is equipped with several features, namely games to hone the extent to which students' ability to do discrete math exercises randomly, with the reward in the game, the questions are designed to be more difficult and graded, Fuzzy Sugeno algorithm calculates logic to determine rewards based on time variables and problem solving. This application has an AR (Augmented Reality) feature to provide 3D views and videos on discrete mathematics textbooks, 30 algorithm testing with 100% accuracy."
