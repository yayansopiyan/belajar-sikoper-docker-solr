        "To the west of Sumbawa there are stone vats, a part of megalithic culture, which spread at several sites in the Regency and City of Bima, Sumbawa Island (West Nusa Tenggara). The study carried out in this area was more focused on site distribution, shapes of jars, and manufacturing techniques. Investigation result reveals eight sites dispersed at the villages of Rora, Palama, and Kumba, where 21 jars are found. The jars consist of 18 bodies and 3 lids.
